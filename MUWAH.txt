Hellooooo mamshie! HAHAHAHA finallyy, nandito ka na. Anyway, happiest birthday to you mamshie koo! I suppose you've already gone through my little gifts for you. I've been thinking for quite a while on what to gift you and since I can't decide, I just got you all of them. ðŸ˜‚ You're too good for me to settle with just one gift. (Mamshie mong indecisive :< HAHAHA)

Somwy pala if I may have been a bit 'busy', 'too sleepy', or 'too tired' lately HAHAHA I just needed excuses so I can prepare everything. I know that up until now, you're still not so secure about me. You still can't fully trust me especially after everything that happened, but I just want to at least lift a bit of your worries through this. You're my one and only mamshie, always, as long as you accept me as your mamshie too. 

Other than that, I'm just really thankful that I have met you. I've always prayed for guidance but never thought that He'll give me someone to actually help in guiding me. ðŸ’™ I appreciate every little thing that you do for me. Thank you for always choosing to stay. ðŸ¥º

So yon, my last gift for your birthday is the Gift Card HAHHAHAHA I'll let you choose any gift that you specifically want. 50m na muna max amount since salty mamshie lang meron ka now ðŸ˜‚. Let me know once you have decided on something. ðŸ¤— 

MUWAAAAAAHHH!! ðŸ’™ðŸ§¡

PS. Yes po panget handwriting ko, stop judging. Hmp!

Extra PS. I made this part a little bit tricky kase epal ka mamshie nung nagkamali ako ng screenshot na sinend HAHHAHAHAHAHAHA chena KISSSSUEE ðŸ˜˜
