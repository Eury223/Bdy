Hellooooo mamshie! HAHAHAHA finallyy, nandito ka na. Anyway, happiest birthday to you mamshie koo! I suppose you've already gone through my little gifts for you. I've been thinking for quite a while on what to gift you and since I can't decide, I just got you all of them. ðŸ˜‚ You're too good for me to settle with just one gift. 

Somwy pala if I may have been a bit 'busy', 'too sleepy', or 'too tired' lately HAHAHA I just needed excuses so I can prepare everything. I know that up until now, you're still insecure about me. You still can't fully trust me especially after everything that happened, but I just want to at least lift a bit of your worries through this. You're my one and only mamshie, always, as long as you accept me as your mamshie too. And in case you didn't know, I'm just really thankful that I have met you. I've always prayed for guidance but never thought that He'll give me someone to actually help in guiding me. ðŸ’™ I appreciate every little thing that you do for me. Thank you for always choosing to stay. ðŸ¥º

So yon, my last gift for your birthday is the Gift Card HAHHAHAHA I know we both prefer staying in rather than going out but since it's your birthday, let's make an exception. Let's go out on a date mamshie! All expenses will be on me ðŸ˜˜ I'll also give you the chance to choose 1 gift that you specifically want (Mamsh except PS5 though HAHAHAHAHA)

Pick a date when you're available and let me know. MUWAAAAAAHHH!! ðŸ’™ðŸ§¡

PS. Yes po panget handwriting ko, stop judging. Hmp!
